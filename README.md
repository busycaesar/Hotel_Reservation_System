# Hotel Reservation System

## Description

This is a hotel reservation management system for **Hotel Blue Queen**. Hotel customers can use the system to fill in the information and based on that, the system can suggest the number of room/s the customer should take. Subsequently the customer can go ahead and book room/s as per the choice. The application also has an admin dashboard which shows all the information, such as how many rooms are book, list of the guest staying in the hotel etc. The admin dashboard has the authority to make/stash any booking.
